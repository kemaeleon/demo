Crawl a web page
----------------

The most simple way to use our program is with no arguments.
Simply run::

        crawler <url>

        to crawl a webpage.

        Crawl a page slowly
        -------------------

        To add a delay to your crawler,
        use :option:`-d`::

                crawler -d 10 <url>

                This will wait 10 seconds between page fetches.
